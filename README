shockBurst -- a simple library implementing NRF24L01+ Shockburst protocol 

https://github.com/turdusmerula/ShockBurst


Shockburst is a simple library implementing the shockburst protocol of the 
NRF24L01+ for the avr.
This library was inspirated by the Mirf library but was rewritten for my own
need (and mainly because I needed to fully understand what was done).

PREREQUISITES:
The library uses the SPI library from the Arduino project.
The examples will need:
 - the Enerlib library (http://arduino.cc/playground/Code/Enerlib)
 - the FlexiTimer2 library (http://arduino.cc/playground/Main/FlexiTimer2)
